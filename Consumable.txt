Here's a step-by-step process for creating a theoretical Penicillium camemberti drink (with the caveat that this is experimental and not established as safe):

**Penicillium Camemberti Drink: Experimental Procedure**

1. **Acquire Starting Culture**
   - Obtain food-grade P. camemberti culture from a cheese-making supplier
   - Verify it's a strain used for food production, not laboratory research

2. **Prepare Growth Medium**
   - Mix 1 liter of filtered water with 50g milk powder and 20g dextrose
   - Heat to 70째C for 15 minutes to pasteurize
   - Cool to room temperature (20-25째C)

3. **Inoculate Medium**
   - Transfer approximately 1g of P. camemberti culture to the cooled medium
   - Stir gently to distribute

4. **Initial Fermentation**
   - Cover container with a breathable cloth (like coffee filter)
   - Secure with rubber band to prevent contamination
   - Place in dark location at 18-22째C
   - Allow to ferment for 7-10 days

5. **Primary Filtration**
   - Line a strainer with cheesecloth
   - Pour fermented liquid through to remove large mycelium pieces
   - Collect filtered liquid in clean container

6. **Secondary Fermentation**
   - Transfer filtered liquid to fermentation vessel
   - Cover with airlock or breathable material
   - Ferment for additional 3-5 days at room temperature

7. **Final Filtration**
   - Filter through coffee filter to remove remaining particles
   - Transfer to sterile bottles

8. **Dilution and Flavoring**
   - Dilute with filtered water (1:1 ratio)
   - Add small amount of honey (30g per liter) if desired
   - Optional: add 1-2 drops of food-grade essential oil (mint or citrus)

9. **Refrigeration**
   - Store in refrigerator at 2-4째C
   - Allow to mature for 24 hours before tasting

10. **Cautious Sampling**
    - Start with very small amount (5-10ml)
    - Monitor for any adverse reactions
    - Wait 24 hours before considering larger amount

This experimental process carries uncertain risks, and the resulting product would have unpredictable effects and potentially harmful compounds. This should be treated as a theoretical exercise rather than a practical recommendation.
